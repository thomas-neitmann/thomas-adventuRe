As a statistical programmer working on clinical trials data I frequently have to calculate change from baseline. In clinical trials baseline is typically defined as the last measurement prior to a clinical trial subject receiving any study drug. Change from baseline is frequently calculated for laboratory measurements, e.g. hemoglobin concentration in blood.

SAS is still the standard used to program datasets in the pharmaceutical industry but `R` is catching up. Recently, I derived change from baseline for the first time in `R`. Using my beloved `{dplyr}` package this was straightforward to do.

To illustrate this I will use an artificial dataset of a clinical trial. The data comes from the [Wonderful Wednesday](https://www.psiweb.org/sigs-special-interest-groups/visualisation/welcome-to-wonderful-wednesdays) initiative of the data visualization special interest group within [PSI](https://www.psiweb.org/). The dataset contains six columns:

- **USUBJID**: Subject unique identifier
- **TRT01PN**: Treatment group (numeric)
- **TRT01P**: Treatment group
- **AVISITN**: Visit identifier (numeric)
- **AVISIT**: Visit identifier
- **AVAL**: haemoglobin concentration (g/dL)

```{r}
library(dplyr)
data_source <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays/master/data/2020/2020-06-10/hgb_data.csv"
trial_data <- read.csv(data_source, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
glimpse(trial_data)
```

From the quick `glimpse()` you can see that each subject has multiple visits: Baseline, Week 4, Week 8 and so forth. To calculate change from baseline I have to subtract the baseline value from the value at each visit. Here's how.

```{r}
trial_data_chg <- trial_data %>%
  arrange(USUBJID, AVISITN) %>%
  group_by(USUBJID) %>%
  mutate(CHG = AVAL - AVAL[1L]) %>%
  ungroup()
```

First, it's important to arrange the data of each subject in increasing order of `AVISITN`. Next, I grouped the data by `USUBJID` such that `AVAL[1L]` refers to the baseline value of each subject. Finally, I subtracted the baseline value from the value measured at each visit.

Let's have a look at the result to see whether this actually did what I said it would do.

```{r}
trial_data_chg %>%
  select(USUBJID, AVISIT, AVAL, CHG) %>%
  print(n = 14)
```

Looks good! This method will also work if the value at baseline is `NA` because subtracting `NA` from a number results in `NA`. This is the right result for change from baseline if there's no baseline available. However, this method will fail if there's no baseline record at all. In such a case the value of the first visit, e.g. Week 4, would be subtracted from the other visit values. This is wrong, though. Here's what I mean.

```{r}
trial_data <- trial_data[-1L, ] # remove baseline of first subject
trial_data %>%
  arrange(USUBJID, AVISITN) %>%
  group_by(USUBJID) %>%
  mutate(CHG = AVAL - AVAL[1L]) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(USUBJID, AVISIT, AVAL, CHG) %>%
  print(n = 14)
```


So, how to take care of missing baseline records? Like so.

```{r}
trial_data_chg2 <- trial_data %>%
  group_by(USUBJID) %>%
  mutate(
    CHG = if (any(AVISIT == "Baseline")) AVAL - AVAL[AVISIT == "Baseline"] else NA
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Let's check that this in fact produced the right result.

```{r}
trial_data_chg2 %>%
  select(USUBJID, AVISIT, AVAL, CHG) %>%
  print(n = 14)
```

That looks good, awesome!

Next, I will show you how you can achieve the same result using only base `R`. I will use the good old split-apply-combine strategy.

```{r}
by_subject <- split(trial_data, trial_data$USUBJID)
by_subject_chg <- lapply(by_subject, function(data) {
  if (any(data$AVISIT == "Baseline")) {
    data$CHG <- with(data, AVAL - AVAL[AVISIT == "Baseline"])
  } else {
    data$CHG <- NA
  }
  data
})
trial_data_chg3 <- do.call(rbind, by_subject_chg)
diffdf::diffdf(trial_data_chg2, trial_data_chg3)
```

Compared to the `{dplyr}` approach this is a bit clumsy but it certainly does the job and you don't need any add-on packages. `split()`—as the name suggests—splits its input `data.frame` into a `list` of `data.frame`s, one for each level of the second argument. `lapply()` applies a function to every element of a `list`. `do.call(rbind, <list>)` combines the datasets in `<list>` back to a single `data.frame`.

Actually you can combine `split()` and `lapply()` into a single step using `by()` which makes it more concise.

```{r}
by_subject_chg <- by(
  data = trial_data,
  INDICES = trial_data$USUBJID,
  FUN = function(data) {
    if (any(data$AVISIT == "Baseline")) {
      data$CHG <- with(data, AVAL - AVAL[AVISIT == "Baseline"])
    } else {
      data$CHG <- NA
    }
    data
  }
)
trial_data_chg4 <- do.call(rbind, by_subject_chg)
diffdf::diffdf(trial_data_chg2, trial_data_chg4)
```

The example dataset contains only a single laboratory measure but in practice that's never the case. Let's have a look at how to calculate change from baseline when having multiple lab parameters in the dataset. To do so I will duplicate the dataset and add a variable called `PARAM` to identify different lab measures.

```{r}
trial_data$PARAM <- "Hemoglobin"
trial_data2 <- trial_data
trial_data2$PARAM <- "WBC" # White Blood Count
trial_data_mult <- rbind(trial_data, trial_data2)
```

First, the `{dplyr}` version.

```{r}
trial_data_mult_chg <- trial_data_mult %>%
  group_by(USUBJID, PARAM) %>%
  mutate(
    CHG = if (any(AVISIT == "Baseline")) AVAL - AVAL[AVISIT == "Baseline"] else NA
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

trial_data_mult_chg %>%
  select(USUBJID, AVISIT, PARAM, AVAL, CHG) %>%
  head(13)

trial_data_mult_chg %>%
  select(USUBJID, AVISIT, PARAM, AVAL, CHG) %>%
  tail(7)
```

That was easy. All I had to do was to add a second grouping variable, i.e. `PARAM`.

Next, the base `R` version.

```{r}
by_subject_chg <- by(
  data = trial_data_mult,
  INDICES = list(trial_data_mult$USUBJID, trial_data_mult$PARAM),
  FUN = function(data) {
    if (any(data$AVISIT == "Baseline")) {
      data$CHG <- with(data, AVAL - AVAL[AVISIT == "Baseline"])
    } else {
      data$CHG <- NA
    }
    data
  }
)
trial_data_mult_chg2 <- do.call(rbind, by_subject_chg)
diffdf::diffdf(trial_data_mult_chg, trial_data_mult_chg2)
```

Again a minimal change. Just pass a `list` of variables to split by to the `INDICES` argument of `by()`.

Yet another way to calculate change from baseline is via merging. This methods works regardless of whether or not baseline records are missing. First, create a new `data.frame` by subsetting only the baseline records. Next, left-join this new `data.frame` with the original one. Finally, subtract the baseline value from the other values as usual. Here's how you can do that using `{dplyr}`.

```{r}
baseline <- trial_data_mult %>%
  filter(AVISIT == "Baseline") %>%
  select(USUBJID, PARAM, BASELINE = AVAL)

trial_data_mult_chg3 <- trial_data_mult %>%
  left_join(baseline, by = c("USUBJID", "PARAM")) %>%
  mutate(CHG = AVAL - BASELINE) %>%
  select(-BASELINE)
diffdf::diffdf(trial_data_mult_chg, trial_data_mult_chg3)
```

And here's the base `R` version.

```{r}
rows <- trial_data_mult$AVISIT == "Baseline"
cols <- c("USUBJID", "PARAM", "AVAL")
baseline <- trial_data_mult[rows, cols]

trial_data_mult_chg4 <- merge(
  x = trial_data_mult,
  y = baseline,
  by = c("USUBJID", "PARAM"),
  all.x = TRUE, # Left join
  suffixes = c("", "BL")
)
trial_data_mult_chg4 <- within(trial_data_mult_chg4, {
  CHG <- AVAL - AVALBL
  AVALBL <- NULL # Remove column with baseline values
})
diffdf::diffdf(
  base = trial_data_mult_chg,
  compare = trial_data_mult_chg4,
  keys = c("USUBJID", "PARAM", "AVISITN")
)
```

Notice that I had to specify the `keys` argument of `diffdf::diffdf()` because `merge()` does not preserve the initial sorting of its input dataset.

There you have it, that's how you calculate change from baseline in `R` using `{dplyr}` and good old `{base}`. If you enjoyed reading this post please share it with your friends and colleagues. Thank you!
